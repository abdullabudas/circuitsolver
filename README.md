# circuitsolver
circuitsolver is a Python-based tool designed to solve DC circuits using the loop analysis method. It can handle both dependent and independent sources in a circuit.

Circuit Conventions:
Positive loop current: Clockwise  
Resistance: In kilo ohms (kÎ©)  
Current: In milliampere (mA)  
Conductance: In millisiemens (mS)  
Voltage: In volts (V)  
Sample Usage:

Circuit
